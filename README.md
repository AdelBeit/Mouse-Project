# Mouse-Project (work in progress)


Second prototype progress:
3d modeling an easily removable glove that has 2 fingers and a case for the micro pro that sits on the back of your hand.
Looking at different motion sensors, IMU sensor looks promising.


First prototype iteration:
accelerometer attached to 3 push buttons, sits on the back of the hand, controls mouse movement using an accelerometer, only reads tilt change not actual linear motion.
